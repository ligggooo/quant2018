PR Merge Criteria
-----------------

**Attention**: Please make sure that you merge your PR into `dev`, if it's a **feature**, and into `master` if you supply a **hotfix**! Also ensure you're developing from `dev`, not `master`, since the latter is not always kept up-to-date!

For a PR to be merged, the following statements must hold true:

-  PEP8 has been enforced
-  All commits of the PR are atomic
-  The pull request was approved by a core maintainer
